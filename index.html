      <p>
        This tool provides 
        <ol>
            <li>An approximate UK→US GPA estimate </li> 
            <li>A <strong>Competitiveness Score</strong>.</li>

        The score is <strong>not</strong> an official “acceptance probability”. It is a practical indicator based on typical expectations for MS CS tiers plus your selected profile strengths.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Is a UK 2:1 good enough for MS CS in the USA?</h3>
      <p>Often yes. For top tiers, strong research/projects and strong letters can matter a lot.</p>

      <h3>Is 68% a good grade for MS CS in the USA?</h3>
      <p>68% is usually a high 2:1 and is viewed positively by many programs.</p>

      <h3>Do US universities convert UK grades to a GPA?</h3>
      <p>Some convert internally, some use credential evaluators, and some assess holistically.</p>

      <h3>Do MS CS programs care more about CS module grades or overall grades?</h3>
      <p>CS + maths module performance often matters more, but overall performance still matters.</p>

      <h3>Can projects and internships offset a slightly lower GPA?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes yes. Strong proof of ability can improve competitiveness.</p>

      <h3>Is this an official conversion?</h3>
      <p>No, it’s a guide. Always check each university’s evaluation approach.</p>

      <h2>Important notes (read this)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Estimates only:</strong> Different universities use different evaluation methods; there is no universal UK→US GPA rule.</li>
        <li><strong>Holistic admissions:</strong> GPA is one component. Projects, internships, research, SOP, and LORs matter a lot for MS CS.</li>
        <li><strong>Tier is a simplification:</strong> “Top 10/25/50” is for guidance; each school has its own expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>No guarantees:</strong> This tool does not predict accept/reject outcomes.</li>

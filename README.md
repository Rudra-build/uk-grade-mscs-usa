# UK Grade → MS CS USA Competitiveness Tool

Hey 👋

I built this as a UK Computer Science student applying to MS CS programs in the United States.

I kept overthinking questions like:
- Is my 2:1 good enough?
- Is 68% competitive?
- What does this translate to in US GPA terms?

So I built a small tool that:
- Estimates a US-style GPA from a UK grade  
- Gives a competitiveness score for Top 10 / Top 25 / Top 50 programs  
- Suggests practical next steps to strengthen your profile  

This is not an official conversion tool. Just a realistic guide based on common grading interpretations and typical expectations.

## Tech

Simple stack:
- HTML  
- CSS  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- Hosted on GitHub Pages  

All ideas, logic, and code were written by me.

I did use AI to help structure and clean up the content so it reads better and is easier to understand, but the project concept and implementation are entirely my own.

If you're applying from the UK to MS CS in the US, I hope this helps you think more clearly about where you stand.

Feel free to open issues or suggest improvements.
